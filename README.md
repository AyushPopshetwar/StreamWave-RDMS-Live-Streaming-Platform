# StreamWave-RDMS-Live-Streaming-Platform ðŸŽ¥ðŸŒŠ

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Welcome to **StreamWave** â€” a database system I designed for an online live-streaming platform.  
The platform caters mainly to **two types of users**: **Content Creators** and **Viewers**.  

I chose to work on this idea because I noticed that this area was relatively unexplored from a **database perspective**, and I wanted to tackle a unique system that I was also familiar with.  

Initially, I thought this task would be quite simple, but as I delved deeper, it kept getting more complex. This taught me that **creating a database system is more challenging than it may seem**.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Stores data relevant to **streaming platforms** (inspired by Twitch & YouTube).  
- Designed **from the userâ€™s perspective** (thinking as both viewer and creator).  
- Supports **queries for user accessibility** and meaningful insights.  
- Experience in **data modeling, database design, functional dependencies, and normalization**.

## ðŸ“– Learning Experience  
This project gave me practical experience in:  
- **Database Design & Relational Schema**  
- **Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)**  
- **Functional Dependency Sets**  
- **DML & DDL Queries**  
- **Teamwork and problem-solving**  

It also helped me apply the concepts taught in class, and I appreciate the freedom Sir gave us to choose our own topic.

## âš¡ Challenges Faced  
- Determining **relations and their cardinalities**  
- Handling **data anomalies and abnormalities**  
- Ensuring the **proper functioning of queries**  
- Making the **database accessible to users**

## ðŸ”® Future Scope  
In the future, I plan to:  
- Add **postponed functionalities** due to time constraints  
- Work with **larger datasets** for better scalability and performance
